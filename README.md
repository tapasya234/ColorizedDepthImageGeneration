# ColorizedDepthImageGeneration
The aim is to generate Colorized Depth Images using Color and Depth frames, detect an orange and purple ball in each frame and calculate the relative velocity of the balls.

Data provided: Color and Depth frames of initial and final frames of a sequence, captured from Microsoft Kinect. 
               Timestamp of the captured frames
               Intrinsic matrix for RGB camera
               Rotation matrix between RGB and depth camera
               Inverse of the intrinsic matrix of the depth camera

To work on this project, a good understanding of the color and depth cameras and the generation of the colorized depth is required along with detection of the orange ball and the purple ball and about calculating relative velocity.
